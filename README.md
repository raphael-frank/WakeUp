# Wake Up

<h3>Itch.io Page: https://alexstarzengruber.itch.io/wake-upÂ </h3>

Wake Up was created during my university's Semester GameJam in December 2022. It is a 2D horror puzzle game where you play as a boy in a haunted mansion and solve riddles to escape.

The game was developed within a span of 42 hours using the Unity Engine by a team of six people. I was responsible for programming the riddles, handling the level engineering, and contributing to the overall design of the game's puzzles.
